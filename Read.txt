												Utility For IndexedDB 

IndexedDB:
IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data. While Web Storage is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution. This is the main landing page for MDN's IndexedDB coverage â€” here we provide links to the full API reference and usage guides, browser support details, and some explanation of key concepts.(Reference MDN
